🌿 Analyzing Air Quality in Vitória, Brazil: A Data and Sustainability Project 📊

As part of my learning journey in data analysis with R, I explored air quality data provided by the IEMA, focusing on nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) levels in Vitória, ES. This project allowed me to work with tools like dplyr, ggplot2, and modeling techniques such as ARIMA, integrating my passion for chemistry, data, and sustainability.

🔍 Project Objectives
Using real-world data to:

Analyze temporal trends in air pollution.
Identify seasonal patterns and potential climatic correlations.
Model and forecast monthly NO₂ levels for 2025.
✨ Key Results
1️⃣ Data Transformation and Analysis:

Box-Cox Transformation: Solved issues with non-stationary variance.
Visualizations: Charts revealed clear trends, inspiring further questions about environmental impacts.
2️⃣ Modeling and Forecasting:

Adjusted model: ARIMA(1,1,0)(1,1,0)[12].
Training Errors:
RMSE: 7.54.
MAPE: 24.14%.
Results suggested a stable trend in NO₂ levels for 2025.
3️⃣ Impact and Reflections:

With simple tools, it's possible to transform environmental data into actionable insights.
This highlighted the importance of factors like traffic and climate in refining future analyses.
🎯 Why Does This Matter?
Air pollution directly impacts our health and the environment. Projects like this demonstrate how data analysis can support more sustainable decisions, from environmental management to public policy development.

Beyond a technical exercise, this project is a step toward understanding how data, chemistry, and sustainability can come together to create positive impacts. 🌱
